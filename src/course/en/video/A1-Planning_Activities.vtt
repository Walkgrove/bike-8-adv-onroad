00:00.040 --> 00:03.279
- Okay guys, what kind of
riding do you want to do today?

00:03.279 --> 00:06.000
You gonna ride to work?
Ride to the station?

00:06.000 --> 00:07.879
- I'd say at work and

00:07.879 --> 00:08.720
into town?

00:08.720 --> 00:09.560
- Yeah? Into town?
- Yeah.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.519
- Okay, do you wanna
ride on the cycle path

00:11.519 --> 00:13.240
or do you wanna ride on the roads?

00:13.240 --> 00:15.240
'Cause we have quite a few choices.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.800
- Hmm.
- I prefer cycle path.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.839
- Yeah? Is that because they're quieter?

00:18.839 --> 00:19.679
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:19.679 --> 00:21.239
They can be a little bit further,

00:21.239 --> 00:23.039
but obviously they're very quiet.

00:23.039 --> 00:23.879
But I think-

00:23.879 --> 00:25.559
Should we learn to ride
on the road as well?

00:25.559 --> 00:26.399
Get some skills to learn

00:26.399 --> 00:27.839
on the ride.
- Yeah, I prefer on the road,

00:27.839 --> 00:29.760
but yeah, I can understand
it can get busy.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.800
- Yeah. Yeah, it can, but it's-

00:31.800 --> 00:34.159
You've quite a direct
route, often, on the road.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.880
Okay. Brilliant. How might
you plan your journey?

00:36.880 --> 00:37.920
- I usually use Google Maps?

00:37.920 --> 00:39.679
- Okay. So you take your phone with you?

00:39.679 --> 00:40.560
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you always take

00:40.560 --> 00:42.280
your phone with you when you go riding?

00:42.280 --> 00:43.320
Yeah. It's a good decision,

00:43.320 --> 00:44.159
- Yeah.
- I think. Yeah,

00:44.159 --> 00:45.320
- Yeah.
- it's a good decision.

00:45.320 --> 00:46.479
So what sort of other things might you

00:46.479 --> 00:48.280
take with you when you go riding?

00:48.280 --> 00:49.119
- A water bottle.

00:49.119 --> 00:49.840
- Water bottle. Brilliant. 

00:49.840 --> 00:51.840
Having a drink of water is a good idea.

00:51.960 --> 00:52.799
- Some tools.

00:52.799 --> 00:54.799
- Some tools? What kind of things, Matt?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.439
Allen keys, puncture repair kit.

00:57.439 --> 00:59.159
- [Instructor] Brilliant. Yeah. Okay.

00:59.159 --> 01:00.600
What if you get a flat tyre?

01:00.600 --> 01:01.479
- Inner tube?

01:01.479 --> 01:05.120
- Inner tube. How you gonna inflate it?

01:05.120 --> 01:06.159
- [Together] A pump.
- Yeah. Brilliant.

01:06.159 --> 01:07.840
With a pump. Fantastic.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.280
Anything else you might take?

01:11.640 --> 01:12.560
- I take a lock.

01:12.560 --> 01:13.680
- Okay. Lock. Yeah.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.799
So if you wanna stop at the
shops or anything like that,

01:15.799 --> 01:17.120
pick your lunch up or whatever.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.680
You can lock your bike outside.

01:18.680 --> 01:19.879
It's a really good idea.

01:19.879 --> 01:21.000
Do you lock it through the wheels

01:21.000 --> 01:22.599
or through the frame?

01:22.599 --> 01:23.439
I do both.

01:23.439 --> 01:24.920
- Okay. Yeah, good, good.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.280
If you can, do both.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.519
If you can't, I think just lock it

01:27.519 --> 01:29.640
through the frame's
probably the best idea.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.560
What about our changeable
weather in the UK?

01:31.560 --> 01:32.480
What might you have in your-

01:32.480 --> 01:33.319
- Oh, a jacket.
- Yeah!

01:33.319 --> 01:34.359
Jacket's a really good idea.

01:34.359 --> 01:37.439
Make sure you are dressed
appropriately for the conditions.

01:37.439 --> 01:39.200
'Cause they can change quite quickly.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.560
Absolutely. And if you are
carrying this kind of stuff,

01:41.560 --> 01:42.400
'cause it sounds like you've got

01:42.400 --> 01:43.560
quite a lot of stuff with you,

01:43.560 --> 01:46.319
if you're carrying it,
how might you carry it?

01:46.319 --> 01:47.359
- [Matt] Oh, backpack.

01:47.359 --> 01:49.280
- Backpack. Brilliant. Yeah.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.200
Do you think it's a good idea to have

01:50.200 --> 01:52.359
that backpack on your handlebars?

01:52.359 --> 01:53.200
- No.
- No?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.879
No, it's not good to
control your bike, is it?

01:55.879 --> 01:58.599
So, backpack or maybe a frame bag

01:58.599 --> 02:00.200
or something like that
to carry everything.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.640
Yeah. Great. Okay.

02:01.640 --> 02:02.959
Brilliant, should we do some riding?

02:02.959 --> 02:04.239
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Let's go.
