00:00:04.553 --> 00:00:06.570
<v ->And we check to the right.</v>

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.673
If it's clear for us, on we go.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.583
Well done.

4
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.463
Well done.

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.000
And now I'm just gonna pop in behind you

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.530
in the cycle lane, and you carry on.

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.583
Okay? Well done.

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.670
Okay, good "pass me" position, Matt.

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.020
Before we get to the traffic lights,

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.850
we're going to move into the "follow me" position.

11
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.680
So have a look around, check behind you,

12
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.000
move into the "follow me" position.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.530
We might even go into the cycle lane

14
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.440
and go 'round these cars into the advanced box.

15
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.720
Do that if you're comfortable.

16
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.270
And we're gonna go left.

17
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.770
Well done, well done.

18
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.733
Good road position.

19
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.183
Well done.

20
00:00:53.183 --> 00:00:54.510
Stay in the "follow me" position

21
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.000
all the way 'round the corner buddy.

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.960
Comfortable, Matt?

23
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.793
<v ->Yep.</v>
<v ->Good.</v>
