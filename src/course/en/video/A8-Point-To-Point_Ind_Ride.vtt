00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.380
<v ->So what what we're gonna do</v>

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.900
is we're gonna ride around the gyratory.

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.660
which is like a giant roundabout, okay.

4
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.970
So it works the same way as a roundabout,

5
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.080
and it's a one-way system.

6
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.350
You can see from the sign there that it's a one-way system.

7
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.290
Which way do you think the traffic approach is from?

8
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.435
<v Matt>The right.</v>

9
00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:18.600
<v ->Yeah, it's the same as the roundabout.</v>

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.030
So the traffic approaches from the right hand side.

11
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.780
So if you are joining the gyratory at any stage,

12
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.750
you have to check to the right before you join it, okay.

13
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.830
There's a few options here.

14
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.750
You can ride around the gyratory,

15
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.310
or you could use the bike path.

16
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.960
You see it's got the shared bike path there.

17
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.840
So if you're not comfortable riding on the road

18
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.690
with all this traffic,

19
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.600
you can ride on the bike path as well.

20
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.669
So there's a few options.

21
00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:45.669
Just use the traffic lights as other road users would do so.

22
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.840
So if it's, you know, obviously, if it's green, it's go.

23
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.130
If it's red, it's stop.

24
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.880
When we ride around a traffic roundabout or this gyratory,

25
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.385
we like to ride in the middle of our lane.

26
00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:59.400
And if you ride in the middle of the lane that you are in,

27
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.590
you are in control of that lane.

28
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.740
And it means that nobody can overtake you on the roundabout.

29
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.889
You're in a strong position

30
00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:08.280
and it means that you're in control of your lane.

31
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.921
That's the best place to be in.

32
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:10.798
<v Matt and Farrah>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:10.798 --> 00:01:14.070
<v ->And you see traffic is giving way to the right.</v>

34
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.330
So it's just works the same

35
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480
as you would work with a normal roundabout.

36
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.160
<v ->He's in the middle of the lane, look.</v>

37
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.030
<v ->In the middle of the lane.</v>

38
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.880
<v ->Like just like he told us.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:27.213
<v ->This case.</v>

40
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.870
Oh yeah, he's stopping in the bike box.

41
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.720
<v Farrah>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:33.172 --> 00:01:34.850
<v Matt>Pedal ready.</v>

43
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Farrah>Yeah, brakes on, oh.</v>

44
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.130
<v Matt>And off he goes.</v>

45
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.903
Oh, there he is.

46
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.130
Oh, he's going into a different lane this time.

47
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.293
<v Farrah>He was in the middle.</v>

48
00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.006
Oh, he's trying to get out and around.

49
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:50.343
<v Matt>Ah, yes.</v>

50
00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:52.238
<v Farrah>Yes.</v>

51
00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:53.071
<v Matt>There he goes.</v>

52
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:53.904
<v Farrah>And he's...</v>

53
00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:54.893
<v Matt>Checking over his shoulder a lot.</v>
