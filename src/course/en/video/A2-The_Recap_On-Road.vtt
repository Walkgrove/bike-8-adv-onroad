00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.350
<v ->In a moment we're gonna ride out.</v>

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.350
We're gonna do a left hand turn out of this side road.

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.518
<v Farrah>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:05.518 --> 00:00:08.220
<v ->Right up there, maybe do a U-turn by that pilon.</v>

5
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.170
Don't go any further by that pilon there.

6
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.730
And then come back down,

7
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.530
and turn right back into the side road from the main road.

8
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.630
Do another U-turn sort of down by the end

9
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.011
of that wall somewhere there.

10
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:21.537
Don't go any further.

11
00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:25.170
Okay, what sort of position do you think is a good position

12
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.010
to be in when you're negotiating a junction?

13
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.280
Do you think it's good to be right next to the curb?

14
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.113
<v Farrah>No.</v>

15
00:00:33.113 --> 00:00:34.350
<v ->No, that's the pass position.</v>

16
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.780
Do you think it's better to be in the following position

17
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.240
where you're in control of your side of the lane?

18
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.493
Remember we discussed that before?

19
00:00:40.493 --> 00:00:41.326
<v ->Yes.</v>

20
00:00:41.326 --> 00:00:43.743
<v ->Yeah, so you're in the middle of your lane okay?</v>

21
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.980
Another thing you have to do, obviously, which is

22
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.210
what all these drivers are doing

23
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.640
as well, is do lots of looking.

24
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.580
So observations are really key for us.

25
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.580
Do lots of looking when you're about to join the main road,

26
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.127
and then when you're about to turn back into the side road.

27
00:00:59.127 --> 00:01:00.870
Think about who goes first.

28
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.237
You know what priority means, or right of way, yeah?

29
00:01:04.237 --> 00:01:07.620
We have exactly the same rules as other road users.

30
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.570
As drivers you would know, you know how

31
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.042
the road system works.

32
00:01:11.042 --> 00:01:14.100
How can you also let other road users know

33
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.590
what you're going to do if you're going to do a turn?

34
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.423
<v ->A signal?</v>

35
00:01:17.423 --> 00:01:18.904
<v ->Yeah. Communicate to them.</v>

36
00:01:18.904 --> 00:01:22.560
Make eye contact with them by looking over your shoulder.

37
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.470
Communicate to them with hand signals,

38
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.820
and that kind of thing, okay?

39
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.199
So think about looking, think about priority.

40
00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:32.490
Think about whether it's you who goes first,

41
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.640
or whether it's the other road user who goes first.

42
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.074
Think about communicating or signalling to other road users,

43
00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:41.580
and think about your road position, okay?

44
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.415
Shall we have a go at it?

45
00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:43.256
<v Farrah>Yeah.</v>

46
00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:44.093
<v ->Brilliant.</v>

47
00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:52.989
Hands back on the handlebar, Matt, before you make the turn.

48
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.233
Good road position.

49
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.150
Check behind you again, Farrah before you turn.

50
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.263
That's it. Well done.

51
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.210
Great road position, Matt. Well done.
