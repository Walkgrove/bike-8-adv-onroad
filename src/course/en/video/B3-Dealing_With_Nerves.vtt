00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.520
<v ->Okay guys, how you feeling?</v>

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.353
Yeah?
<v ->Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:03.353 --> 00:00:04.186
<v ->Wanna do some more riding?</v>

4
00:00:04.186 --> 00:00:05.310
Not too tired?

5
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.110
<v ->No, I'm okay.</v>
<v ->Brilliant.</v>

6
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.660
We're gonna move on now to another part of the course

7
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.930
where we might go to somewhere that's potentially busier.

8
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.700
Big roundabout in the middle of town.

9
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.940
It's potentially got more traffic, faster moving traffic.

10
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.840
Okay, is that something

11
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.910
that you're feeling comfortable doing?

12
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.990
<v ->Yeah, I think I'll be alright with that.</v>

13
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.830
<v ->Yeah? Good.</v>

14
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.663
What about you, Farrah?

15
00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:24.660
<v ->I'm a little bit uncertain.</v>

16
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.650
<v ->Oh, okay.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.483
<v ->Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:26.483 --> 00:00:27.750
<v ->Just because how busy it is.</v>

19
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.710
<v ->How busy it is.</v>

20
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.970
It will be a little bit busier,

21
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.740
but you've done brilliantly so far,

22
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.750
so, if you remember some of the road positions

23
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.930
that we've done and remember do lots of looking,

24
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.460
we're well within our right to be there,

25
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.980
'cause we're traffic users as well, okay?

26
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.420
We'll stay together as a group.

27
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.560
I'll be with you the whole time

28
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.313
and we'll take it nice and steady.

29
00:00:45.313 --> 00:00:46.146
<v ->Okay.</v>

30
00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:46.979
<v ->And if you ever got any worries or anything,</v>

31
00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.500
just let me know and we'll take it nice and slowly.

32
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.039
Fancy giving it a go?

33
00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.140
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Brilliant.</v>

34
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.995
Let's go ride.

35
00:00:52.995 --> 00:00:53.828
<v Farrah>Okay.</v>
