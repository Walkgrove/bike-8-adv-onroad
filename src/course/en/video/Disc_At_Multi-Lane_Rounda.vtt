00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.834
<v ->Okay guys, what have we got in front of us?</v>

2
00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:03.667
<v ->Roundabout.</v>
<v ->Roundabout.</v>

3
00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:04.500
<v ->A roundabout.</v>

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.150
In a moment, we're going to come riding up here,

5
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.900
and we are going to turn right and go round the roundabout.

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.430
Okay. Do you know which direction

7
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.540
the traffic is coming from?

8
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.430
If you have a look, you can see.

9
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.263
<v ->From the right?</v>

10
00:00:15.263 --> 00:00:16.096
<v ->From the right.</v>

11
00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:17.687
Okay. So which way is it going?

12
00:00:17.687 --> 00:00:18.520
<v ->Clockwise.</v>

13
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.353
<v ->Clockwise. Brilliant.</v>

14
00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:20.910
Do you think it's a good idea,

15
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.110
when you go round a roundabout,

16
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.140
to be in the "pass me" position near the curbside?

17
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.190
Or do you think it's a good idea

18
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.810
to be in the "follow me" position

19
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.940
in the middle of your lanes?

20
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.773
<v ->"Follow me".</v>

21
00:00:30.773 --> 00:00:32.310
<v ->Yeah. Be in the middle of your lane</v>

22
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.500
so you are in control of your lane.

23
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.170
Okay. Do we need to do any signalling?

24
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.670
<v ->Do we signal for the exit?</v>

25
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.080
<v ->Do you signal for the exit?</v>

26
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.370
If there's a car there, yeah.

27
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.750
Have a good look around

28
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.450
and signal it if there's a car there, okay?

29
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.160
And then get your hands back on the handlebar

30
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.450
before you make the turn.

31
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.460
So make the signal nice and early,

32
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.440
and then that lets other road users know

33
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.330
which way you are going to go as well.

34
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.740
Everybody feeling comfortable about it?

35
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.573
<v ->Yeah.</v>

36
00:00:56.573 --> 00:00:58.992
<v ->So just "follow me" position all the way around.</v>

37
00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:00.791
Okay. Should we write it together as a group first?

38
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:01.624
<v ->Yeah, let's do it.</v>

39
00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:02.457
<v ->Excellent. Brilliant.</v>

40
00:01:02.457 --> 00:01:03.363
Okay, let's go.
